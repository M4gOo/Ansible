==================== Conditionals ===============================
Some server has different server with that we can use a conditional which the playbook will run the appropriate task
when: condition ; or ; and ; == ; 
Ex.: when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

Can use conditionals in loop.
vars:
  packages:
    -name: nginx
    required: true
    -name: mysql
    required: true
tasks
-name : Install "{{ item.name }}" on Debian
   apt:
      name: "{{ item.name }}"
when item.required == True   
loop: '{{ packages }}'


Can use register to save the output and use further in the playbook

==================== Loops ===============================
avoid repeating lines

tasks
  -user: name='{{ item }}  state=present
  loop:      (could be -> with_items:)
    - klooop
    - manuer
    - zac
    - ibra
    

double variable
tasks
  -user: name= '{{ item.name }}'  state=present uid= '{{ item.uid }}'
  loop:    (could be -> with_items:)
    - name: klooop
      uid: 1010
    - name: manuer
      uid: 1011
    - name: zac
      uid: 1012
      

==================== Roles ===============================
assign server with a role must need all requisites to make, for example, a mysql (install packages, configure mysql service, configure DB and users)

Roles can re-use your configuration
to install and configure basics configurations you can package it into a role and reuse it later, because this task remain mostly common.

in the playbook it will be
roles:
  -mysql
  
 
 Roles can help organize all taks into a task directory
 Roles can help in sharing your code with others in the Ansible Community (Ansible Galaxy)
 ansiible-galaxy search mysql
 ansiible-galaxy install nameoftheguy.mysql
 ansiible-galaxy install nameoftheguy.mysql -p ./roles   (to install in the current dir under roles)
 ansiible-galaxy list
 ansiible-galaxy dump | grep mysql
  
 To start with the role use the ansible galaxy command, this tool will initialize and create a directory structure
 ansible-galaxy init mysql
 
 then move all of your code into the task directory into a file and that's it
 
 If I have my playbook and want to use a role that ansaible-galaxy initialize I can
        -> move everything ansible-galaxy dir under my-playbook>roles>mysql
        -> move the roles in this default Ansible location /etc/ansible/roles
        -> configure in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg the path for the roles
