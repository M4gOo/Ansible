==================== Conditionals ===============================
Some server has different server with that we can use a conditional which the playbook will run the appropriate task
when: condition ; or ; and ; == ; 
Ex.: when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

Can use conditionals in loop.
vars:
  packages:
    -name: nginx
    required: true
    -name: mysql
    required: true
tasks
-name : Install "{{ item.name }}" on Debian
   apt:
      name: "{{ item.name }}"
when item.required == True   
loop: '{{ packages }}'


Can use register to save the output and use further in the playbook
