==================== Inventory ===============================
it is agentless, dont need install additional software on the target machines to work with Ansible
it is required to configure an agent on the target system before using any kind of automation
information about these target systems is stored in an INVENTORY FILE (INI format). If you dont creatte one, Ansible will use the default (/etc/ansible/hosts)

create an alias  -> web ansible_host=192.0.2.50.
                 -> db ansible_host=server3.company.com 
In case doesnt have other host you can use -> localhost ansible_connection=localhost    
    
ansible_host        -> IP or FQDN(domain name)
ansible_connection  -> how is connect to target server ssh or winrm
ansible_port        -> port will be connected
ansible_user        -> defines the user used to make remote connections
ansible_password (win)
ansible_ssh_pass (linux)

#
To create groups:
[web_servers]
web1
web2
web3

[db_servers]
db1

#
To create group of groups:
[web_servers]
web1
web2
web3

[db_servers]
db1

[all_servers:children]
web_servers
db_servers


==================== Playbooks ===============================
It is Ansible's orchestration language
where we define what we want Ansible to do
They are written in yaml format
it is a list of dictionaries in YAML

in the playbooks all connection info for the host is retrieved from inventory file.
    if specify a group in hosts inside the playbook, the listed tasks will be executed on all the hosts listed under that group simultaneously
Ex.:
-
    name: 'Execute two commands on web_node1'
    hosts: boston_nodes
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Execute a date command'
            command: date
        -
            name: 'Execute a command to display hosts file'
            command: 'cat /etc/hosts'


the different actions run by tasks are called modules (command, script, yum, service and others 100s)

to run the playbook -> ansible-playbook playbook-file-name.yaml
