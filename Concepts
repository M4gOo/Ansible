==================== Inventory ===============================
it is agentless, dont need install additional software on the target machines to work with Ansible
it is required to configure an agent on the target system before using any kind of automation
information about these target systems is stored in an INVENTORY FILE (INI format). If you dont creatte one, Ansible will use the default (/etc/ansible/hosts)

create an alias  -> web ansible_host=192.0.2.50.
                 -> db ansible_host=server3.company.com 
In case doesnt have other host you can use -> localhost ansible_connection=localhost    
    
ansible_host        -> IP or FQDN(domain name)
ansible_connection  -> how is connect to target server ssh or winrm
ansible_port        -> port will be connected
ansible_user        -> defines the user used to make remote connections
